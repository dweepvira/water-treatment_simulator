The goal is to cause physical consequences (tank overflow or drainage) while bypassing state-estimation and bad data detection (BDD) algorithms.","Provides a detailed mathematical framework for generating sophisticated, ""low-and-slow"" attacks that are harder to detect than simple, brute-force attacks. Assumes attacker has limited access (only to pump and total demand readings).","Yes. Highly relevant for the attack generation phase. You can use this model to create advanced, stealthy FDI attack data for your dataset. This will make your dataset more robust and challenging for the ML/DL models you train."
"Real-Time Cyberattack Detection for SCADA in Power System by Botta Prudhvi, Prashant Khare, Maddikara Jaya Bharata Reddy [paper14]","Simulated IEEE 14 Bus system (a power system, but the network attack principles are directly transferable).","Executed a variety of network-layer attacks (MAC spoofing, Ping flood, UDP flood, Smurf attack) using tools from the Kali Linux distribution. Used Wireshark for network traffic analysis and attack detection. Validated results in a real-time Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) setup using OPAL-RT.","Very practical, hands-on paper.

It simulates Replay, Packet Injection, and DDoS attacks to validate the framework.","Focuses on a defensive mechanism that can be added to existing protocols without major infrastructure changes. The use of SHA256 for session-based authentication is a key concept.","Yes. Useful for both attack and defense simulation. You can simulate the described attacks (Replay, Packet Injection) to generate data. Later, you could potentially implement their proposed defense mechanism on your simulator to test its effectiveness against your ML/DL detectors."

Extremely useful for the honeypot-building phase. It provides a practical guide on *how to build a resilient honeypot that can survive an attack*. The discussion on remote logging is a vital lesson for your project to ensure your own dataset isn't lost.

Conducted reconnaissance attacks (port scanning, address scanning) using Nmap and other tools. Captured the network traffic, extracted features, and trained several traditional ML models (Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.) to detect the attacks.","This paper is almost a complete, end-to-end description of your project plan.

"An approach for formal analysis of the security of a water treatment testbed by Sai Sidharth Patlolla [thesis]","Data from the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) testbed.","Used a formal methods approach, Multiple Security Domain Nondeducibility (MSDND), to model and analyze information flow security. The goal was to identify Stuxnet-like attacks that hide critical information. Developed physical invariants (e.g., relating flow rates to tank levels) to detect when sensor data contradicts physical laws, thus revealing corrupted information paths. The security model was also verified using the ProVerif tool.","This work takes a highly theoretical, formal-methods approach to security analysis. It's less about ML and more about provably secure system design. The core idea of using 'invariants' (physical rules the system must obey) as a ground truth for detecting attacks is powerful.","Yes. Very useful for the simulator and attack detection design phase. The concept of physical invariants is a crucial one to build into your simulator. You can use these invariants as a rule-based detection method to benchmark your ML/DL models against. For example, if your simulator knows that turning on Pump A must cause the level in Tank B to rise, and your dataset shows an attack where this doesn't happen, that's a key data point. It provides a way to generate physically implausible but logically possible attack scenarios."
